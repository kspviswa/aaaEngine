# aaaEngine
CPP Implementation of AAA Engine that glues RADIUS &amp; TACACS+ client together.

## Dependencies
* [ace-radius](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ace-radius/?source=typ_redirect) for RADIUS client stack
* [pam_tacplus](https://github.com/kspviswa/pam_tacplus) for TACACS+ client stack
* 
## Note
The source of [ace-radius](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ace-radius/?source=typ_redirect) & some part of client source of [tacplus] ( along with libtac ) (https://github.com/kspviswa/pam_tacplus) have been directly used in the project. So *aaaEngine* will literally glue both RADIUS & TACACS+ client stack together. The source of OSS have been directly used and this project has been released under [MIT license] (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
