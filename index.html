<p>Compact all-in-one AAA engine supporting most popular AAA protocols ( RADIUS / TACACS+ ) and has ambitious plans to add more protocols in future. 
<code>aaaEngine</code> can be used to model any AAA client. As of now, the engine supports single-thread, request-response based architecture, which is well suited for AAA client needs. In future, server stack will be implemented to support both client &amp; server stacks.</p>

<h2>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sleek API</strong> - All you need is the library &amp; include files. Only 4 APIs are needed for complete operation. It is irrespective of the underlying AAA protocol. Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/kspviswa/aaaEngine/wiki/How-to-build-the-library-using-eclipse-cdt">how to build a client page</a> for more details.</li>
<li>
<strong>Scalable Design</strong> - Lot of efforts had been put into the design of <code>aaaEngine</code> to make it scalable and complete. It would take less amount of effort to introduce / depreciate a AAA protocol, without affecting the entire API design itself.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ambitious plans</strong> - <code>aaaEngine</code> project has been started recently. It was born out of frustration of not having a consolidated aaa stack for client purposes. Though started with minimum scope, the project has got ambitious plans for the future. Please refer the <a href="https://github.com/kspviswa/aaaEngine/labels/enhancement">enhancements</a> lined up for this project.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pure Opensource</strong> - This project is released under <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a> which makes ideal for commercial &amp; opensource usage.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>aaaEngine</code> project does not contain the <code>Makefile</code> or <em>pre-compiled</em> libraries. Instead it gives you freedom to use the source at your will under any existing build ecos-system. If you are ardent fan of <code>eclipse-cdt</code> ( like me ), then please refer to  <a href="https://github.com/kspviswa/aaaEngine/wiki/How-to-build-the-library-using-eclipse-cdt">how to build a client page</a> for more details.</p>
